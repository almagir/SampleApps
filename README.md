# Nymi Sample Applications

This repository contains code in various languages for sample applications that consume the Nymi C++ API.  Primarily these apps are meant to act as examples of how to wrap the JSON-based NAPI with other types of data structures.

Currently there are two sets of samples apps for C++ and Java.  Both have project files that support both Windows and Mac OS X.  See the appropriate directories for README files specific to each language.

Note: The Nymi SDK, and therefore these sample apps, are not supported on macOS Sierra.
