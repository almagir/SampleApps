# Java Sample Applications

All projects in this directory were created as Eclipse projects and were built using the Neon version of Eclipse.

##NapiJavaWrapper Sample

This project isn't strictly an application.  It produces a single JAR file that acts as a Java library wrapping the Nymi API in a purely Java implementation. 

Building the JAR requires a copy of the NAPI dynamic library wrapper (see the Cplusplus directory for that code). A copy of the pre-built library is included in the source tree (under `/src/win32-x86-64` for Windows and `/src/darwin` for OS X) but can be updated by building a new version at any time.  The project has been configured as a Maven project and should be built using Maven for easiest dependency-resolution.  If you prefer not to use Maven you will need to modify the project to manually load JAR files for JNA (https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) and JSON-Java (https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) on the build path for the project.

To use the library, create your own singleton copy of the `NymiJavaApi` class (using the `getInstance()` method) and implement the `NapiCallbacks` interface (which is passed to the `init()` method of the `NymiJavaApi` object) to register methods to handle responses from the API.  For a short example of how to do this, take a look at the `JavaNapiSample` project.

##JavaNapiSample Sample Application

This short project is a direct port of the `NapiCpp` application from the Cplusplus sample app.  It provides a simple command-line interface to pass commands to a Nymi Band and receive responses.  Most of the interface code is contained in the `Util` class which also handles a few other features of the app.  Feel free to use code for this app to build or extend your own Java applications.
